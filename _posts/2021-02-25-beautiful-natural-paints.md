I love painting so much, and it feels extra special to make paint from materials around me. The things you will need are a collinder, some empty mason jars, paint brushes, a mortar and pestle, mud, water, and found leaves, flowers, and grasses in pretty colors.



To start, collect the leaves, flowers, and grasses you wish to be paint.

Grind them with the mortar and pestle; you don't need it to be very fine, but you want it to release its color into the water for later.

Add a tiny, tiny bit of mud into your water, and mix it. 

Add your crushed up pigment into the mud-water mix.

Let it sit there and sink in, and then drain the liquid with the collinder, into the jars, filtering out the flecks of leaf, flower, grass etc.

You made paint!
