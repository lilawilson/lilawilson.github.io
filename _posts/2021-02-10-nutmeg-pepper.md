We have the cutest dwarf goats! Meet Pepper and Nutmeg, our favorite goats! They are brother and sister, born less than a year ago, and today the were enjoying the sun. Pepper was taking a nap, and Nutmeg was grazing. You will totally be hearing more of them. In fact, I just got head-butted by them, and uh... wow. These things have escaped maybe 20 times already! Anyway, I'll leave you to stare at them in awe now.
