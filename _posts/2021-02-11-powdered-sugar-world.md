Where we live, snow comes very rarely! But, when it does snow, it snows a lot. Now, we're  supposed to get ten inches in **a single day!** I was soooo sad when I woke up and saw plain old green grass, but then, I saw the snooow! Is anyone else as excited as me? I was cackling earlier! Nutmeg and Pepper are not thrilled. Ellie the barn cat is curled up in her heated bed, and the chickens packed into one nesting box to keep warm. I guess maybe humans are weird. I don't know. I think dogs are weird, so maybe it just depends who you are. What? Oh I'm off topic. Back to the snow! I'm staring out the window hypnotized, so maybe I should look away for once, and stay on track. The trees are totally white, and I wish snow days were still a thing in school... Is anyone else obsessed with these pretty white trees? *Oh, yeah, Lila, totally!* See! Thanks for responding! Oh my gosh! I have to go now, but wow! This snow is aaaaaaaammmmazing!
